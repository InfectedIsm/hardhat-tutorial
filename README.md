## Hardhat Tutorial
This is the [official tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial) from Hardhat go set up a first hardhat environment, test and deploy a smart contract

During my first steps in web3 development I used using Truffle (as the training a was following were using it), but had to much issues with it over time and decided to try hardhat

Don't forget to run 'npm ci' to install required packages 

#### Comments
I've directly added into the code (as comments) the tutorial comments, so that you can just navigate through the code and understand what is going on
I also added some of my own comments to make the code more understandable for a newbie

#### Tests
You will find 3 test files, each one showing different test implementation, the final one being Token.js :
* Token-fixture.js
* Token-nofixture.js
* Token.js
